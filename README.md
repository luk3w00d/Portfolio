## Purpose and target audience

The portfolio website is to demonstrate my ability to create a website with the skills learnt in the first three weeks of study at coder academy. The target audience is for possible future employees to show my web development skills.



## Function and futures

I designed the website to be simple to navigate through while still maintaining a interactive site
while still maintaining a responsive design to fit the current devices.

-Index: contains all important contact information and includes navigation to other pages as well as a self portrait.

-About: This page contains information about why i decided to make a move to web development, My previous work history with a link to my resume pdf and my hobbies which includes some explample photos.
